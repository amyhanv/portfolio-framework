            <p>
                This is an app I made for <a href="http://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank">Company & Co</a>, I used this technology and that strategy. This project was developed in one day (big shout out to khaled and his keys to success). I like cookies and milk, I hope you do to!

                I developed this very website you are looking at right now in front of you it's actually in your computer screen. <a href="http://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank">My inspiration</a> is what really came through in the design. This project was developed in one day (big shout out to khaled and his keys to success). Check out my <a href="">blog post</a> for more about my process!
